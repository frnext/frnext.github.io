### Cultural Nuances in Greeting Etiquette  

French greetings often carry deeper cultural significance than those in English or Ukrainian. Here are some important points:  

1. **Handshakes**: A light, brief handshake is typical in formal or professional settings.  
2. **La bise** (cheek kisses): In informal or friendly settings, two or more cheek kisses are common. This practice varies by region and is usually reserved for people you know well.  
3. **Use of titles**: In formal situations, titles such as ==Monsieur== (Mr.) or ==Madame== (Mrs./Ms.) are used when addressing others.

### Formal vs. Informal Styles (==tu== vs. ==vous==)  

In French, there are two ways to address someone:  

1. **==tu== (informal)**:  
   - Used with friends, family, children, and peers.  
   - Example: ==Salut, tu vas bien ?== (Hi, are you well?).  

2. **==vous== (formal)**:  
   - Used in professional, polite, or formal settings, or with strangers.  
   - Example: ==Bonjour, comment allez-vous ?== (Good morning, how are you?).

### Comparing with Ukrainian and English  

#### Similarities:  
- Ukrainian also differentiates between formal (==ви==) and informal (==ти==) speech, much like ==vous== and ==tu== in French.  
- In both Ukrainian and French, it is polite to greet people with titles (e.g., ==пан== in Ukrainian and ==Monsieur== in French).  

#### Differences:  
- English does not differentiate between formal and informal "you." The tone or context conveys the level of politeness.  
- French greetings are typically more ritualistic, with an emphasis on formal politeness compared to the casual nature of many English greetings.  
- La bise has no direct equivalent in either Ukrainian or English culture.

### Practice  

#### Phrases to Practice  

1. **Formal greeting and introduction**:  
   - ==Bonjour, je m’appelle Paul. Enchanté, Madame.==  
   - (Good morning, my name is Paul. Nice to meet you, Madam.)  

2. **Informal greeting and introduction**:  
   - ==Salut, je m’appelle Anne. Ça va ?==  
   - (Hi, my name is Anne. How’s it going?)  

3. **Asking how someone is (formal and informal)**:  
   - ==Comment allez-vous ?== (formal)  
   - ==Ça va ?== (informal)  

4. **Saying goodbye**:  
   - ==Au revoir, Monsieur. À bientôt !==  
   - (Goodbye, Sir. See you soon!).  

#### Simulating Situations  

1. You’re meeting a colleague for the first time. Practice this dialogue:  
   - ==Bonjour, je m’appelle Sophie. Enchantée.==  
   - (Good morning, my name is Sophie. Nice to meet you.)  
   - ==Enchanté, Sophie. Je suis Pierre.==  
   - (Nice to meet you, Sophie. I am Pierre.)  

2. You’re greeting a friend:  
   - ==Salut, ça va ?==  
   - ==Ça va bien, merci. Et toi ?==
